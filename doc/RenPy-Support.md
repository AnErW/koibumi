# RenPy Script Support

## The Why

RenPy is a great visual novel engine for NVL/ADV makers as it has been developed for many years. Some developers may not want to rewrite their script(because "The three chief virtues of a programmer are: Laziness, Impatience and Hubris" according to Larry Wall) so it may stop someone to try to use Koibumi.

So that's it! The support of `.rpy` is here! (**Partially** anyway)

## Compatibility Notice

Please be mentioned that it's not recommended to run the script directly as it may contain the uncompatible API. If the script fails to load, please check the supported list below.
